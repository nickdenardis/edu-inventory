								<p align="justify"><b>ACHIEVEMENTS:</b><br>
								American Century University of USA has offered 
								affordable distance learning to working people 
								throughout the world for the past 30 years. 
								American Century University has serviced over 
								13, 000 students, toward Bachelors. Masters, and 
								Doctorates in various disciplines. Alumni of 
								American Century University are self-employed or 
								hold high positions of responsibility in many 
								countries of the world. If the proof of the 
								pudding is in the eating, then students and 
								organizations that sponsored them have 
								thoroughly enjoyed eating. American Century 
								University has achieved at a fraction of the 
								cost of what similar degrees would have cost in 
								a traditional learning university. <br>
								<br>
								<b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>
								American Century University sees its objective 
								in catering all those who, for whatever reason, 
								did not have the opportunity to pursue their 
								academic career in the classical manner. 
								American Century University wants to organize a 
								'second chance' for the many who are already at 
								work, whose thirst for knowledge and ambition 
								for self-fulfillment are not extinguished but 
								who cannot possibly take leave from their job 
								and responsibilities. It addresses very 
								specifically the needs of bright people for 
								advance learning in the developing economies 
								where traditional learning is not available or 
								too expensive, or not able to respond to 
								specific academic challenges of the knowledge 
								economy. American Century University satisfies 
								the desire for advanced learning of anyone who 
								wants to share in the academic excellence of the 
								world. <br>
								<br>
								<b>TESTIMONIALS:</b> <br>
								Many students can affirm the value of their 
								American Century University Degree.<br>
								<br>
								In the words of American Century University 
								Doctoral Degree Graduate, Ward Roofthooft, 
								Ph.D.,<br>
								<br>
								&quot;A new world; A new way of learning:<br>
								<br>
								Wherever we are in the world, whatever the state 
								of our economy may be, whichever way our career 
								may take us, the one inescapable truth is that 
								we already or will soon be in a 'knowledge 
								economy'. Knowledge is the foundations for 
								research and development. It is the dominant 
								factor in production and distribution. It is the 
								strategic edge in marketing. Knowledge products 
								and services create a multitude of the added 
								value that was created by classical products and 
								services. In such an economy, we will only be 
								successful through permanent learning. <br>
								<br>
								While knowledge has taken a giant leap in the 
								quest for control of the economy, the 
								acquisition of knowledge has not kept in step 
								with the accelerated speed of knowledge itself. 
								While knowledge is the subject of a REVOLUTION, 
								learning still seems to be moving as an 
								EVOLUTION. Learning is slowly emerging from the 
								futile encyclopedic dream of Diderot and 
								d'Alembert to the knowledge guzzling economy of 
								today. Chances are that this style of learning 
								will never get where it is supposed to go. For 
								while knowledge moves around with dazzling speed 
								on the computer software highway, learning is 
								still mainly confined to the old-fashioned 
								brick-and-mortar classrooms of yesterday. <br>
								<br>
								The world has changed and is changing with 
								ever-faster speed. Knowledge has exploded. It is 
								about time that the acquisition of knowledge 
								puts itself up to date. University studies in 
								particular should not any longer be locked up 
								exclusively in old buildings with ivy-grown 
								facades. Let the new means of communication come 
								in and take their rightful place in this quest 
								for knowledge that is already shaping our world 
								of today and tomorrow.&quot; <br>
